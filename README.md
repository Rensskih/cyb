## Project state

The project is currently at a concept stage.

It is clear to us that:
1. the idea of addresing things using content addresses in browser makes sense, so it is worth working further on, and
2. the idea of using cyber instead of google right in the browser search bar is also amazing.

That is why our current focus is [the launch of cyber network](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit). Once we achieve that, we can shift more focus into the development of the browser. For now you can:
- [experiment with the software](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases)
- dive deeper into [DURA scheme](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyb/dura/)
- discuss it on our forum [the future of Cyb](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/the-vision-of-cyb/24)
