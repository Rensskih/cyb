## Project state

The project is at concept stage at the moment.

For us it is clear that:
1. an idea of addresing the stuff using content addresses in browser is make sense so it is worth working further and
2. an idea of using cyber instead of google right in browser search bar is also amazing.

That is why our current focus is [cyber network launch](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit). Once we do it we can shift more focus into browser development. For now you can:
- [experiment with a software](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases)
- dive deeper into [DURA scheme](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyb/dura/)
- discuss on the forum [the future of Cyb](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/the-vision-of-cyb/24)
